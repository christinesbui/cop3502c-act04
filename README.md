implementing and maintaining a set of trees

### details
when small monsters were first discovered, they were believed to be confined to forests. for years thereafter, regions where they could be captured were referred to as “forests”, regardless of their actual type of ecological region. the mess this made of the historical record is a story for another time. you are building a program to parse compressed records from that time period. your program will maintain a set of trees, by maintaining a tree of trees to control those trees.
